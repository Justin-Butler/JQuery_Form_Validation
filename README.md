# JQuery_Form_Validation
Form Validation using Javascript/Jquery

The intention of this verification is to make is easier for the user to fix the issues prior to having the form submit. The form will not submit if the information does not meet the proper criteria.

The Email field must meet the proper email criteria and both fields must match. It will not require the case to be the same for the email addresses confirmation.

Password Guidelines:
Must contain atleast One Uppercase letter
Must contain atleast One Lowercase letter
Must contain atleast One Numeric Character
Must contain atleast One Special Character: #!_-?$&%@
Must contain between 8 & 16 characters

Will check the confirmation field and make sure the case matches.


First and Last Name fields must be completed. It will auto-capitalize the first character of both fields as well as the middle initial. It will also require more than one character to be entered into the field for First Name, Last Name, and Security answer.

The date of births will display the correct days of the month dependent on the month and the year.

The final check it will make is to make sure the terms and conditions checkbox is checked off prior to sending.

The remaining Validation and Security will have to be handled server-side.
